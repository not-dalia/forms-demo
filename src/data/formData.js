These questions are about you, your communication or sensory needs, and your general health. You will also be asked to complete some questions about specific symptoms that you may, or may not, have experienced. This is important because it will help the GP work with you to ensure you are treated most effectively. Finally, there is a section about your diet and lifestyle. \n\n Thank you for taking time to complete these questions. If you have any questions about the pre-appointment form, please contact _____."
